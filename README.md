## This project features

* a simple and beautiful Bayesian framework for relative risk estimation
* a paradigm for correcting the multiple comparisons problem in a Bayesian way
* one of the very few real-world examples indicating the equivalence between the Bayesian hierarchical model and the Frequentist method with false coverage rate (FCR) adjustment. 
* findings of elevated risks distributed in various systems: circulatory and cardiovascular, injuries, pregnancy and childbirth, mental and behavioral, stress-related immune, etc.
