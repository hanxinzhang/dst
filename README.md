## This project features

* a simple and beautiful Bayesian framework for relative risk estimation,
* a paradigm for correcting the multiple comparisons problem in a Bayesian way,
* one of the very few real-world examples indicating the equivalence between the Bayesian hierarchical model and the Frequentist method with false coverage rate (FCR) adjustment, 
* findings of elevated risks distributed in various systems: circulatory and cardiovascular, injuries, pregnancy and childbirth, mental and behavioral, stress-related immune, etc.

## Contents

For US all patients (inpatients and outpatients) and US inpatients, we performed analyses on

* all states adopting DST,
* all states adopting DST on pseudo-DST dates as a negative control,
* all states without DST as another negative control,
* all northern, southern, eastern, and western DST states separately,
* all states adopting DST, first diagnoses of conditions of 0â€“10 children who were completely recorded from birth in our data,
* all states adopting DST, first diagnoses, analyzed on pseudo-DST dates as a negative control

using three approaches -- a Bayesian hierarchical model, a Frequentist approximation method, and a half-Bayesian approximation method.

For Swedish inpatients, we performed analyses on 

* medical records since 1980 when Sweden started observing DST,
* medical records before 1980 as a negative control

using two approaches -- a Bayesian hierarchical model and a Frequentist approximation method.
